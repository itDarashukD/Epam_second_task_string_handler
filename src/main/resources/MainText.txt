	    Within an expression, it is possible to mix two or more different types of data as long as they
    are compatible with each other. For example, you can mix short and long within an expression
    because they are both numeric types. When different types of data are mixed within an
    expression, they are all converted to the same type. This is accomplished through the use
    of Javaâ€™s type promotion rules.
        First, all char, byte, and short values are promoted to int. Then, if one operand is a long,
    the whole expression is promoted to long. If one operand is a float operand, the entire expression
    is promoted to float. If any of the operands is double, the result is double.
        It is important to understand that type promotions apply only to the values operated upon
    when an expression is evaluated. For example, if the value of a byte variable is promoted to
    int inside an expression, outside the expression, the variable is still a byte. Type promotion
    only affects the evaluation of an expression.
